# Digimon Lines

Run `npm run dev` to launch local compilation

Prod : https://digimon-lines.vercel.app/

## Explanation

The aim of this project is to show the Digimon evolutions lines by bringing together their species in a line. In avoiding repetitions.
Exceptions : some digimon are available accross lines. It can be due to fusions like Omegamon or in beeing a chimera like Machinedramon. This can also be explained by the fact that the digimon is a cross between two species. Example : MarineDevimon is made by species of Devimon and Gesomon.
